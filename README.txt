Mini JS RPG — Full Package
-------------------------

What's included:
- index.html, style.css, script.js (full game)
- assets/ (pixel sprites, bgm loop, sfx, dialogues.json, quests.json)
- package.json and electron-main.js for packaging as Electron app

How to run in a browser:
1. Open index.html in a modern browser (File > Open File...)
2. Use arrow keys to move. Interact by bumping into NPCs/enemies.
3. Use Save / Load buttons to persist progress.

How to run as Electron app:
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. In project folder, run: npm install
3. Start with: npm start
(That will install Electron as devDependency and run the app)

Files generated by this pack were created programmatically. You can edit script.js to expand quests, enemies, or add art.

Enjoy!
